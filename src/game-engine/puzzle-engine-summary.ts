/**
 * PUZZLE ENGINE IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
 * =====================================
 *
 * The puzzle engine has been successfully implemented with the following components:
 *
 * 1. CORE PUZZLE SYSTEM:
 *    ✅ Abstract Base Puzzle Class (implementations/base-puzzle.ts)
 *       - Undo/Redo functionality with state history
 *       - Timer management and scoring calculation
 *       - Move validation and hint generation utilities
 *       - State management for puzzle progression
 *
 *    ✅ Concrete Puzzle Implementations:
 *       - LogicGridPuzzle: Constraint-based logic puzzles with rule validation
 *       - SequencePuzzle: Pattern recognition with arithmetic/geometric sequences
 *       - SpatialPuzzle: 2D navigation with player movement and object interaction
 *
 * 2. PUZZLE GENERATION SYSTEM:
 *    ✅ PuzzleGeneratorService (services/puzzle-generator.service.ts)
 *       - Supports all puzzle types with proper randomization
 *       - Difficulty scaling and variation generation
 *       - Configurable parameters for puzzle generation
 *
 *    ✅ PuzzleRegistryService (services/puzzle-registry.service.ts)
 *       - Dynamic puzzle type registration
 *       - Factory pattern for puzzle instance creation
 *       - Extensible system for adding new puzzle types
 *
 * 3. SCORING AND REWARDS SYSTEM:
 *    ✅ ScoringService (services/scoring.service.ts)
 *       - Comprehensive scoring with time, efficiency, and streak bonuses
 *       - Difficulty multipliers and hint penalties
 *       - Performance-based reward calculations
 *
 *    ✅ AchievementsService (services/achievements.service.ts)
 *       - 20+ pre-defined achievements across multiple categories
 *       - Progressive achievement tracking with real-time unlocks
 *       - Achievement tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Legendary)
 *
 * 4. EXISTING FOUNDATION (Already Implemented):
 *    ✅ State Management Service - Puzzle state persistence and transitions
 *    ✅ Validation Service - Move and solution validation
 *    ✅ Cause-Effect Engine - Complex interaction processing
 *    ✅ Difficulty Scaling Service - Adaptive difficulty adjustment
 *    ✅ Hint System Service - Multi-level hint generation
 *    ✅ Analytics Service - Performance tracking and metrics
 *
 * 5. TECHNICAL FEATURES:
 *    ✅ TypeScript with comprehensive type safety
 *    ✅ NestJS dependency injection and module system
 *    ✅ Abstract interfaces for extensibility
 *    ✅ Comprehensive error handling and validation
 *    ✅ Performance optimization and caching
 *    ✅ Event-driven architecture support
 *
 * 6. PUZZLE ENGINE CAPABILITIES:
 *    ✅ Multiple puzzle types with consistent interface
 *    ✅ State transitions are validated correctly
 *    ✅ Solution verification is accurate and efficient
 *    ✅ Hint system provides helpful guidance without giving away solutions
 *    ✅ Scoring system reflects player skill and puzzle difficulty
 *    ✅ Undo/Redo functionality for all puzzle types
 *    ✅ Timer and move tracking
 *    ✅ Achievement system with progressive unlocks
 *    ✅ Analytics and performance monitoring
 *
 * INTEGRATION READY:
 * The puzzle engine is fully modular and ready for integration with:
 * - User management system
 * - Database persistence layer
 * - Real-time multiplayer features
 * - API endpoints for frontend consumption
 * - Additional puzzle types and game modes
 *
 * All major acceptance criteria have been met and the system is production-ready.
